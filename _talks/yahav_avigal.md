### Abstract 
Robot arms have the potential to increase productivity, reduce costs and injuries, and alleviate the impact of labor shortages in a variety of industries, including logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, surgical procedures, and healthcare. Each application requires specific algorithms, tools, sensors, and manipulation capabilities to achieve the task. However, all applications require the robot to move from a given pose to the desired pose efficiently without colliding with obstacles. Jacobi is working to address this need and help developers unlock their robot arms' full potential with minimal effort.
