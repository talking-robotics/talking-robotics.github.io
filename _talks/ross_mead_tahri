### Speaker 
Dr. Ross Mead is the General Organizer of the 2024 International Symposium on Technological Advances in Human-Robot Interaction (TAHRI), which is the premier symposium for HRI research focused on the advancement of the underlying technology enabling the interaction between a robot and a human.

Dr. Mead is the Founder and CEO of Semio. Ross received his PhD and MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern California in 2015, and his BS in Computer Science from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2007.  Ross’s dissertation work focused on socially assistive robots, specifically, on the principled design and computational modeling of fundamental social behaviors (such as speech, gestures, eye gaze, social spacing, etc.) that serve as building blocks for automated recognition and control in face-to-face human-robot interactions. His research provides the foundations upon which Semio software is being built.

Beyond Semio, Dr. Mead serves on the Board of Directors for three nonprofit organizations: (1) Semio Community to support the development of open hardware, software, and data, and fostering reproducible, replicable, and generalizable science within HRI; (2) AI LA to promote artificial intelligence in the Los Angeles community; and (3) the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics to promote robotics and STEM in K-12 education around the globe, with a focus on underrepresented populations.  In 2018, he co-founded the Social Robot Community Slack team to spark an international community around robotics and natural language technologies.  Previously, Ross also served as a technical and scientific advisor to Disney, Intel, and National Geographic, among others.

### Abstract
We are excited to announce the 2024 International Symposium on Technological Advances in Human-Robot Interaction (TAHRI)! TAHRI 2024 is the premier symposium for HRI research focused on the advancement of the underlying technology enabling the interaction between a robot and a human. The inaugural event will be held on March 9–10, 2024 in Boulder, Colorado, USA, two days before and co-located with the 2024 HRI conference! The theme for the inaugural TAHRI is “Building Bridges Between Builders”, gathering HRI researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government, and other research groups who are focused on the development of HRI technologies.

TAHRI is an inclusive, community-focused venue focused on the latest technological advances in HRI, and invites novel, high-quality technological HRI papers that will be peer-reviewed in a flexible process, presented live at the symposium, and indexed in archived ACM proceedings. The TAHRI submission site opens on Monday, November 6th, 2023!

In this informational session, Dr. Ross Mead will provide a brief overview of TAHRI, including its past history, present plans, and future directions for building a community, home, and platform for technological HRI research, and will also answer questions about TAHRI from the general human-robot interaction community.
