## Speaker

Dr. Grollman leads the Core team for Plus One Robotics, where the motto is “Robots Work, People Rule.”  With over a decade of experience in productizing Human-Robot Interaction (Vecna Technologies, Sphero Inc, Misty Robotics), his work centers on applying academic research to commercial problems.  At Plus One Robotics, his focus is building systems that enable robots and humans to continuously learn from each other. A self-described ‘full stack roboticist,’ Dr. Grollman was a postdoctoral fellow at EPFL, received his Ph.D and Sc.M in Computer Science from Brown University, and his B.S in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Yale.

## Abstract

In this talk I'll discuss the long-tailed and shifting distribution of parcels in fulfillment and distribution centers and show how utilizing an adaptable, symbiotic human-AI vision system is the best way to approach the realities of volume and variability. Based on the assumption of change, rather than the anticipation of control, humans and AI working together can handle infinite variety as it occurs.
