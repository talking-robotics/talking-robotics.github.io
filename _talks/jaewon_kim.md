### Speaker 
Dr. Jaewon Kim is currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before joining MIT, he received Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in August 2023 (Advisor: Dr. P. R. Kumar). His research focus includes cyber-physical systems (CPS), cyber-security for CPS, system identification, machine learning, multi-agent unmanned vehicle systems, middleware, real-time resilient network for unmanned aerial & ground vehicles, and cloud/fog robotics.

### Abstract
In the forthcoming decades, there will be a widespread large-scale deployment of Networked Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) on a substantial scale to meet global demands in areas such as energy, oil and gas, water, healthcare, transportation, robotics, etc. However, as recent events have shown, such systems are vulnerable to potential cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, and other malicious events. We present a general-purpose pro-active cyber-attack defense methodology called "Dynamic Watermarking (DW)" for detecting malicious activity in networked systems of sensors and actuators. It provides a provable guarantee of detection of any non-zero power attack. We present the results of attacks on a process control system, a tethered helicopter, an autonomous vehicle, and a grid-tied solar photovoltaic power distribution systems.
