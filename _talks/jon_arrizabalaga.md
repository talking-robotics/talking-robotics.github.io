### Abstract 
Robotic systems have made remarkable progress in recent years, demonstrating increasingly sophisticated capabilities. However, they remain less reliable, adaptable, and efficient than their biological counterparts. This talk examines a key reason for this gap: the perspective from which actions are decided and executed. While biological organisms act from a first-person, egocentric viewpoint, most autonomous robotic systems rely on third-person abstractions. Motivated by this discrepancy, the talk is based on the premise that adopting an egocentric perspective in control and decision-making can help bridge the performance gap between robots and animals. To this end, we will develop a foundation for egocentricity across all modules of autonomous decision-making—ranging from motion description to environment representation—and demonstrate their application to real-world systems. Central to this framework is a rethinking of the three core elements that define motion: the system’s states, its reference frame, and its perception of the surroundings. By addressing each of these components from an egocentric standpoint, the talk outlines a cohesive and principled framework for building more capable and resilient autonomous systems.
