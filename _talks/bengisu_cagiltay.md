### Speaker 
Bengisu Çağıltay is a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, People and Robots Laboratory. Through qualitative and design-based research she explores how social robots can be used in family life and facilitate family routines. She received her PhD minor in Human Development and Family Studies, MS degree in Cognitive Science (’20) from Middle East Technical University, and BS degree in Computer Science (’18) from Bilkent University. Her prior work has been published and recognized in HCI venues including ACM CHI, IDC, and HRI conferences. Her work is supported by funding from NSF.

### Abstract
Challenges in human-robot interaction (HRI) often involve facilitating sustained interactions over a long time, fostering engagement with multiple individuals, and take place in real-world settings. The home environment embodies all three challenges, given that multiple family members regularly interact with technology in their household. In this talk, I will describe my doctoral research where I take a family-centered approach to understand, design, and evaluate how social robots can take part in setting and maintaining shared family routines to support long-term HRI. I will present my prior work including participatory design sessions with families to understand their preferences for having social robots in their home and the interactions we prototyped for robot-facilitated family routines. The remainder of my research will include a series of field studies and evaluations investigating whether long-term engagement in robot-facilitated shared routines can promote stronger family relationships and interpersonal connections.
