## Abstract

3D scene graphs (3DSGs) are an emerging description in the robotics and computer vision communities; unifying symbolic, topological, and metric scene representations. However, typical 3DSGs contain hundreds of objects and symbols even for small environments; rendering task planning on the full graph impractical. In this talk, I will present our findings from building the Taskography benchmark, a large-scale robotic task planning benchmark over 3DSGs. We note that neither classical nor learning-based planners are capable of real-time planning over full 3DSGs. Enabling real-time planning thus demands progress on both (a) sparsifying 3DSGs for tractable planning and (b) designing planners that better exploit 3DSG hierarchies. I will present two techniques that draw from (a) and (b) and result in fast task planning over large scene graphs and in long-horizon tasks.
