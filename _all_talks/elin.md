## Speaker

Elin Björling is a research scientist and co-founder of the Momentary Experience Lab at the Human Centered Design and Engineering, University of Washington (Seattle, USA). Her research leverages a participatory design approach to the research and development of new technologies (social robots and virtual reality) to improve teen mental health.

## Abstract
Social robots have been identified as a potentially desirable and effective therapeutic tool for a diverse range of populations. But how do we gather empirical evidence to inform our social robot research and design requirements? Both design and research of a social robot requires qualitative explorations if we hope to understand our users and their contexts. In this talk, I will briefly demonstrate the use of qualitative and mixed-methods in the development and testing of our own social robot, EMAR.
