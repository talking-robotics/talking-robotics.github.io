## Abstract
There has been a lot of ink devoted to discussions of how robots will replace us and take our jobs. But MIT Media Lab researcher and technology policy expert Kate Darling offers a different path. From a social, legal, and ethical perspective, she shows that robots are likely to supplement―rather than replace―our own skills and relationships. If we consider our history of incorporating animals into our work, transportation, military, and even families, we actually have a solid basis for how to contend with this future.
