## Abstract
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, a research agenda investigated since the era of expert systems saw a renewed interest in recent years. But much research and practise give little attention to the human as the systems' end-user and are done in a vacuum, often ignoring the vast body of literature on explanation and explainability in philosophy, cognitive science and psychology. By unifying theories of causality in cognitive science and AI, I introduce a new explainable model for reinforcement learning agents. A causal model can itself be interpretable, and to provide explanations, I propose new methods for how explanations can be generated, selected and contrasted. I also briefly discuss how causal models can be extended to include different types of causal explanations.
