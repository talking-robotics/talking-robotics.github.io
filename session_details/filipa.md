## Speaker

Filipa Correia received a M.Sc. in Computer Science from University of Lisbon, Portugal, 2015. She is currently a junior researcher at GAIPSLab and she is pursuing a Ph.D. on Human-Robot Interaction at University of Lisbon, Portugal. Her research is focused on the group dynamics and teamwork within mixed teams of humans and robots. In the past years, she was a teaching assistant in the courses of Artificial Intelligence, Multi-Agents Systems, Society and Computing, and Social Robots & Human-Robot Interaction. She had also been part of the EU FP7 EMOTE project.

## Abstract
Recently, the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has been paying close attention to group inter-actions. These type of interactions refer to multi-party settings that extend (traditional) dyads of oneperson and one robot, to cases where there are multiple people and/or multiple robots. My PhD thesis is focused on the challenges of creating social robots that are capable of sustaining cohesive alliances in team settings with humans. The contributions include empirical user studies analysing membership preferences (i.e., social cohesion) and group identification (i.e., collective cohesion) and how those can be influenced by different social behaviours of robotic teammates or by other factors e.g., the outcome of the team. Moreover, it contributes with computational mechanisms for the robotic teammate to autonomously express group-based emotions or to gaze human teammates in multi-party settings.
