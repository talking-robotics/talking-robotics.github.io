## Abstract
Verbal communication is a key challenge in human-robot interaction. For effective verbal interaction, comprehending natural language instructions and clarifying ambiguous user requests are crucial for social robots. To understand the described objects in the requests, the robot should be able to comprehend referring expressions, i.e., the expressions used for describing objects with their distinguishing features. Furthermore, if there are ambiguities in the instructions, the robot should be able to identify these ambiguities and ask follow-up questions by generating referring expressions. In this talk, our latest efforts on comprehending and generating referring expressions will be presented.
