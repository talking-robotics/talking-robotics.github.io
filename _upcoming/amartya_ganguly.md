### Speaker 
Dr. Amartya Ganguly, read his PhD from the University of Hull, UK.  As a postdoc at Keele University, he contributed to the state of the art upper limb neuromusculoskeletal models currently used today. Selected for Horizon 2020 Innosup, he worked at Marsi Bionics, testing the world's first pediatric exoskeleton and establishing a Biomechanics lab with CSIC-CAR Madrid. He developed hand models for clinical use in an EIT Health project at University of Heidelberg, Germany and holds expertise in neuro-musculoskeletal modeling, CE certification, wearable assistive devices, and clinical trials. A recipient of an Indo German Early Career award, he leads the Intelligent Neuroprosthetics research group at TU Munich and contributed to the EU Cost Action initiative for Wearable Robotics.

### Abstract 
This talk provides an overview of integrating biomechanical-informed models into robotic technologies for assistive devices. It highlights musculoskeletal modeling, showcasing its application in cutting-edge prosthetic human-in-the-loop scenarios with demonstrated feedback modalities. The aim is to pave the way for the next generation of prosthetics. The discussion includes the utilization of pattern recognition methods for off-the-shelf prosthetics and explores recent advancements. The talk concludes with insights into the envisioned future of assistive technology as per the research group's perspectives.
