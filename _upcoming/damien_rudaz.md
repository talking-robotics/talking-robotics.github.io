abstract: >
  A large literature points to the fact that many “seen-but-unnoticed“ practices typical of human conversation
  are still not relevantly produced by even the most recent vocal agents. Yet, many of the subtle micro-adjustments
  that make a conversation feel “smooth” and “natural” are difficult to articulate for humans: we often remain
  unaware of their existence until they are missing. In this talk, I will detail some of those (absent) practices
  and show how humans make up for their absence by doing more of the interactional heavy lifting. I will argue
  that this "work to make technology work", which weighs on humans, is often obscured by terms such as "social"
  or "conversational" robots.

  Moreover, an additional difficulty for voice agents is that they evolve in informational ecologies sometimes
  deeply different from those in which ordinary human conversation takes place. For example, when a robot displays
  what it “hears” on its tablet (i.e., when it displays the result of its automatic speech recognition), this
  information is likely to strongly reconfigure the interaction and what actions are ascribed to the robot by
  human participants. I will discuss some consequences of this form of “robot transparency” on conversations.
  Namely, what would happen if, in ordinary conversation, our interlocutors displayed on their forehead a transcript
  of what they hear when we speak?
