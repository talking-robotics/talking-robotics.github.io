## Speaker

Dimos has a background in Human-Computer Interaction and currently works at the Linguistics group at Potsdam University in Germany as a PostDoctoral Researcher. During his PhD at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, he has been a Visiting Research Scholar at Microsoft Research in Seattle, and at the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies in Los Angeles. He is interested in modelling how humans co-produce utterances in interaction within the principles known as audience design, and how conversational user interfaces and robots can simulate such adaptation strategies in interactions with humans.
