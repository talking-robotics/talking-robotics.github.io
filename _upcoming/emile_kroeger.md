abstract: >
    A lot of very exciting progress is happening these days in robotics and in artificial intelligence, and yet, we are far from seeing social robots everywhere. There are many reasons for this; product-market fit (do you need a robot for that?), cost, quality of interaction, complexity of real-world environments, maintenance, connectivityâ€¦ 
    This talk will go over those with case studies from commercial deployments (especially from our "RoboHearts AI" integration of LLM-based conversation, but not only), and also discuss how some of those issues are downstream of fuzzy expectations of what a "robot" is.
