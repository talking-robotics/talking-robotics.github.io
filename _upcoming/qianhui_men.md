abstract: >
    The integration of multimodal AI into healthcare is transforming human decision-making by enhancing real-time guidance in complex medical procedures. Ultrasound scanning, a widely used yet highly operator-dependent imaging technique, requires refined hand-eye coordination to interpret images and manipulate the probe simultaneously. This talk explores how multimodal AI-driven guidance systems can improve sonographic decision-making by integrating visual and motion-based intelligence for more accurate and efficient fetal biometry Standard Plane acquisitionâ€”a critical task in obstetric examinations. I will first introduce our sensor-based multimodal ultrasound guidance system, which employs deep learning to integrate ultrasound imaging, gaze tracking, and probe motion, offering adaptive, real-time guidance to reduce skill dependency and enhance scan consistency. Building on this, I will present a sensor-free AI framework using a 3D fetal atlas for pose estimation and navigation, improving interpretability, accessibility, and eliminating reliance on external motion sensors. This seminar will discuss the broader impact of AI-assisted sonographic navigation, its potential to train non-specialists, and its role in making ultrasound scanning more precise, accessible, and autonomous.
