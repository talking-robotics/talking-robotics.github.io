abstract: >
    I will present Yomix, an interactive tool designed to explore low-dimensional embeddings of omics data, along with related work carried out in collaboration between ISIR and the Curie Institute. 
    
    On the robotics and reinforcement learning side, I will introduce O3P, a library for off-policy and offline RL that I am currently developing. I will also highlight AFU, a recent method enabling online RL with an algorithmic approach that, until now, had proven effective only in offline settings.
