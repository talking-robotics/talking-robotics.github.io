    As generative AI continues to reshape communication and information ecosystems, concerns around misinformation have surged. But what if the AI itself could lie—on purpose? In this talk, we’ll explore intentional deception by artificial agents. What defines a lie for an AI system? What cognitive scaffolding—like beliefs, intentions, or theory of mind—would be required for a machine to deceive? Drawing on work recently presented at the Rebellious and Deceptive AI (RaD-AI) workshop at AAMAS, we’ll examine how mental modeling can be leveraged to automatically generate lies for the purpose of simulating insider threats. Explicitly modeling deceptive behaviors, such as lying, allows for the exploration of a greater range of issues concerning trust and security in autonomous systems.
