abstract: >
    We are steadily approaching a future where humans work with robotic assistants, teammates, and
    even tutors. While significant effort is being dedicated to training robots to work with humans,
    much less attention has been given to the human side of this partnership. For instance, we see
    increasingly capable AI models and algorithms that enable robots to infer human intent, plan
    interactions, and communicate with them. However, human users often lack understanding of
    how robots will react in novel situations and receive minimal training to work with robots. To
    ensure the safe and effective use of robots, I argue that training human users is equally critical.
    This talk will present human-centered computing methods for generating and delivering such
    training. First, I will discuss policy summarization methods that can help generate the training
    content, enabling humans to develop a Theory of Mind regarding the robot. Next, I will discuss
    mechanisms for delivering this training. The talk will conclude with an overview of open
    problems in making this training more effective through personalization and interactions.
