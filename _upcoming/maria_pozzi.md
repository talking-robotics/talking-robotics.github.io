abstract: The advent of soft robotics has greatly changed researchersâ€™ perspective on robotic manipulation. The philosophy of embedding the intelligence of the robot into its structure has led to new prototypes of robotic hands and grippers that show capabilities that were inconceivable with their rigid counterparts. Over the past decade, several different gripper prototypes have been developed, but still the question of how to exploit their embodied intelligence in real-world grasping and manipulation tasks remains open. This presentation will outline on-going research efforts on how to unlock new manipulation skills in soft-rigid grippers, and will discuss the application of soft manipulation principles in human-robot interaction.
