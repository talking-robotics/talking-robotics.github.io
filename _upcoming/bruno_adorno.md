### Speaker 
Bruno Vilhena Adorno received a BS degree (2005) in Mechatronics Engineering and an MS degree (2008) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bras√≠lia (Brazil), and a Ph.D. degree (2011) from the University of Montpellier (France). He is affiliated with the Manchester Centre for Robotics and AI and a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Robotics at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of the University of Manchester. Before joining the University of Manchester, he was an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil, where he co-founded and co-led the Mechatronics, Control, and Robotics research group (MACRO). He is an IEEE Senior Member and was the chair of the Technical Committee on Robotics of the Brazilian Society of Automatics from 2017 to 2020. He has authored or co-authored over 60 journal and conference papers and is currently an Associate Editor for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. His current research interests include both practical and theoretical aspects of robot kinematics, dynamics, and control with applications to mobile manipulators, humanoids, cooperative manipulation systems, and human-robot interaction.

### Abstract 
As a result of more than sixty years of research, there are increasingly more robots working in human environments or alongside humans. With an increasing expectation that robots will actively interact with people and other robots in complex tasks in the homes and factories of the future, we still must solve many theoretical and practical challenges to guarantee the reliability and proper functionality of such complex systems. Robot modeling, control, planning, and high-level task description are commonly treated separately in different layers to manage that complexity. Although that strategy may provide useful abstractions and make the complexity more manageable, it invariably employs techniques that demand intermediate mappings between those layers, which results in a theoretical patchwork that usually introduces unnecessary artifacts in the complete robotic system. In this talk, I will present our efforts to unify robot modeling, control, and planning using a single mathematical language and applications to surgical robots, mobile manipulators, and cooperative robotic systems.
