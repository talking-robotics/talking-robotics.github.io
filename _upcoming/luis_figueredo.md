### Abstract 
Recent breakthroughs in robotics have significantly narrowed the gap between humans and robots. However, the integration of robots into environments that require close co-existence or physical interaction with humans remains largely underdeveloped. Achieving a human-like level collaboration in such close scenarios requires seamless communication and mutual understanding of each other’s abilities—qualities essential to any safe and effective teamwork. To achieve this, robots must not only communicate and understand human natural language, but also develop a nuanced understanding of human physical capabilities, safety, ergonomics and a shared sense of embodiment. This entails integrating layers of responsive, reactive, and safety-certified functionalities into AI-driven multimodal interaction through intuitive language-based interfaces, and biomechanical insights. In this talk, I highlight the core elements of such comprehensive safe and functional approach and the tools to make robots and humans comfortable around each other.
