abstract: "Recent breakthroughs in robotics have significantly narrowed the gap between humans and robots. However, the integration of robots into environments that require close co-existence or physical interaction with humans remains largely underdeveloped. Achieving a human-like level collaboration in such close scenarios requires seamless communication and mutual understanding of each other's abilitiesâ€”qualities essential to any safe and effective teamwork."
